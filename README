DESCRIPTION

This module implements an easy to use search-and-replace API for
substituting parameters into template files.  The Perl module it most
closely resembles is HTML::Template.  It's main advantages over that
module are:

 * it's template syntax is easily configured
 * it implements the Clotho Advanced Media template syntax by default
   (yeah big deal, but it's important to us)
 * it is smaller and, subjectively, more readable

It's main disadvantages under HTML::Template are:

 * it's caching and preparsing are less sophisticated
 * the default template syntax is quirkier
 * it's not as feature rich in syntax and configuration options

If you are starting from scratch, you may prefer HTML::Template.  But,
if you already have a bunch of templates using a syntax that is not
compatible with HTML::Template, this can help.
