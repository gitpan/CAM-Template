CAM::Template

"CAM" stands for Clotho Advanced Media, www.clotho.com, which
supported most of the development of this module.  Contact us at
cpan@clotho.com.

This module implements an easy to use search-and-replace API for
substituting parameters into template files.  The Perl module it most
closely resembles is HTML::Template.  It's main advantages over that
module are:

 * it's template syntax is easily configured
 * it implements the Clotho Advanced Media template syntax by default
   (yeah big deal, but it's important to us)
 * it is smaller and, subjectively, more readable

It's main disadvantages under HTML::Template are:

 * it's caching and preparsing is much less sophisticated
 * the default template syntax is quickier
 * it's not as feature rich in syntax and configuration options

Install via the usual:
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install
